# PRS-
preparation for prs project

client and serveur without .h + work with multiple access to the file , fragmentation is continuous. (time consuming) not optimized)
- serveur waits for client ack before sending others fragments.
- client writes data in the file every time he receives a segment. (time consuming)

No tcp protocols implanted.
