scenario 1:

serveur for client 1 :

it lacks circular buffer for the file and time out, .

client 1 : send ACK in disorder, there is loss some times he sends lots of duplicate ack .

to remove printf use only 2 arguments when launching , otherwise use a 3rd argument 1 preferentely

needs all the other tcp protocol.
