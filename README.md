first step : try to implant multi -thread + make a fixed window to send file as mentionned by the professor
first step check : 

at thi stage , multiple connexions are possible, each process create 2 thread from conversation. 
 
 *depending on how the os gives the mutex to thread, sometimes the listener receive one or several ACK at a time , is it a problem ? 
 perf ? 
 
 * display of "connection process and initialisation whenever the signal is send "==> not cool, pretty , maybe change that ? 

No tcp protocols implanted.
